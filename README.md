# Foundry-DAO
A framework for a Developer DAO on the XRP Ledger.

### **DAO Overview:**

**Purpose**:  
The DAO is designed to build and support a robust platform for launching products and projects on the XRPL (XRP Ledger). It incentivizes community members to participate by maintaining key XRPL infrastructure (nodes and validators) and rewards them with governance power and funding opportunities based on their contributions.

### **Key Components:**

1. **Infrastructure Requirement**:
   - **Node/Validator Hosting**: Members of the DAO are required to host XRPL infrastructure (nodes or validators) to participate. This requirement ensures that only active contributors who provide value to the XRPL network can influence the DAOâ€™s decisions.
   - **Uptime and Version Monitoring**: Token rewards are distributed based on the uptime and version of the hosted nodes/validators. Those who keep their infrastructure up-to-date and running reliably will receive governance tokens as compensation.

2. **Governance Tokens**:
   - **Non-Tradable**: Governance tokens are non-tradable and, therefore, do not have a market value. This prevents speculation and ensures that tokens are solely a reflection of participation and contributions to the DAO.
   - **TOML File Control**: Only addresses listed in a TOML file can hold governance tokens, further securing the DAO by limiting who has governance rights. The TOML file would need to be regularly updated to ensure only active participants are included.
   - **Distribution Mechanism**: Token distribution is triggered by member actions, including:
     - Maintaining node/validator infrastructure.
     - Participating in DAO governance, such as voting or proposing.
     - Completing software development milestones or bounties.

3. **Governance Structure**:
   - **Voting on Proposals**: Governance tokens are used to vote on proposals that influence the direction of the platform. Proposals could include software development bounties, expanding infrastructure, or other technical improvements.
   - **Grant Fund Voting**: The DAO does not hold its own treasury for security reasons. Instead, DAO members vote to release funds from a Ripple Grant. This structure reduces the risk of treasury exploitation, as fund distribution is always transparent and governed by DAO votes.
   - **Bounty Voting**: The DAO can propose and vote on software development bounties to improve the XRPL platform. This process ensures ongoing innovation and incentivizes contributors to build key features or enhancements.

4. **Grant Distribution**:
   - **Incentive Structure**: While governance tokens are not tradable, community members are rewarded with grants (funding) for their development efforts. This ensures that people who actively contribute to the XRPL platform by building products or infrastructure can still be financially compensated.
   - **Merit-Based Compensation**: The size of the grant distributed can be tied to performance metrics, milestones completed, or the overall impact of the contributions made by the developer or team.

### **Expanded Security Measures:**

1. **Immutable Governance Structure**: 
   - The non-tradable nature of governance tokens ensures that only genuine contributors can participate in the decision-making process, removing the risk of governance being swayed by wealthy actors looking to purchase influence. This should be enforced at the protocol level so that the DAO remains decentralized and secure.
   
2. **TOML File Governance**: 
   - To add another layer of security, the process for adding or removing addresses from the TOML file could be governed by the DAO itself. This ensures that the community has control over who can vote, reducing the risk of outside manipulation or governance capture.
   
3. **Checks and Balances on Grant Fund Voting**: 
   - To further reduce the chance of misuse of Ripple Grant funds, additional layers of security could be added, such as:
     - A multi-sig process for releasing funds, ensuring that multiple trusted community members must approve before any funds are distributed.
     - Clear, auditable processes for proposal submission, voting, and fund disbursement to ensure transparency and accountability.

### **Additional Considerations for Clarity and Organization:**

1. **Node/Validator Performance Monitoring**:
   - Consider using third-party or community-built tools to monitor the performance of nodes/validators. Public dashboards could show uptime, version status, and other important metrics for transparency.
   - Uptime bonuses or penalties could be added to encourage consistent participation and ensure only high-performing nodes receive tokens.

2. **Proposal Submission and Voting Processes**:
   - A formal process for proposal submissions should be established. This could include:
     - A set of requirements or templates for submitting a proposal.
     - A discussion period for community members to provide feedback before voting.
     - A clear timeline for when proposals are reviewed and voted on.
   - Proposals could be submitted via smart contracts or a decentralized platform to ensure that everything is transparent and trackable on the XRPL.

3. **Fund Disbursement and Milestone Tracking**:
   - For software development bounties and grants, clear milestones should be defined in advance. Payments could be distributed based on the completion of these milestones, verified either by the community or an elected panel of experts.
   - Consider using escrow functionality on the XRPL to manage funds that are distributed based on milestone completion.

4. **Encouraging Participation and Engagement**:
   - A reputation system could be implemented alongside the governance tokens. Community members could earn reputation points based on their contributions, proposals, and interactions, further incentivizing long-term involvement.
   - Periodic recognition or additional non-financial rewards (e.g., access to exclusive events, educational opportunities) could help build community and encourage continued participation.
