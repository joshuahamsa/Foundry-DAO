### User Story: Tim

As **Tim**, a talented AI artist with no coding experience, I want to **easily turn my one-of-a-kind artwork into NFTs** without needing to worry about technical details like metadata creation or understanding decentralized storage. I’m familiar with buying and selling NFTs on XRPL marketplaces, but the thought of minting my own NFTs feels intimidating because I don’t know how to organize metadata or where to host my files.

Right now, my main obstacle is the complexity of creating an NFT that accurately represents my artwork while being stored securely and accessibly on decentralized networks. I’m also unsure about where to host my artwork in a decentralized way so that it’s always accessible to buyers and collectors. I want a solution that helps me mint NFTs quickly and effortlessly, without requiring me to dive deep into technical topics.

Ideally, I need a **simple drag-and-drop tool** where I can upload my artwork, and the platform will automatically generate all the necessary metadata and guide me through hosting it. I would also appreciate a **step-by-step wizard** that explains technical terms in easy-to-understand language so that I can become more knowledgeable without feeling overwhelmed. My ultimate goal is to showcase my art in the digital space while reaching more collectors without needing to become a tech expert.

### User Story: Janet

As **Janet**, a small business owner who creates custom 3D-printed toys, I want to **start accepting payments in XRP and other tokens on the XRP Ledger** so that I can work with clients in the NFT space who prefer paying in crypto. I’ve been running my online business for years, using credit card payment processors, so I’m familiar with accepting payments—but **accepting crypto feels complex and time-consuming**. I don’t understand what payment channels or escrows are on the XRP Ledger, and I’m not sure how to convert those crypto payments into my local currency.

My biggest frustration is that I don’t have the time to research and set up the whole process on my own. **I want a solution that makes it easy for me to receive crypto payments** and then automatically converts them into my local currency, so I can pay my bills without needing to track the fluctuating value of XRP or other tokens. Ideally, I’d like an **integrated payment system** that works similarly to the credit card processors I’m used to, so that I don’t have to worry about learning the ins and outs of crypto transactions or managing multiple wallets.

If the system could offer **simple explanations** about payment channels and escrows, that would be helpful, but **my priority is automating payments and conversions** so I can focus on running my business and expanding into the NFT merchandise space. **Having detailed reporting tools** to track both crypto and fiat transactions would also help me manage my cash flow and financial planning with ease.

## Chris (Discord Admin)
### User Persona: Chris

- **Name**: Chris
- **Occupation**: Discord Admin for an XRPL NFT Community.
- **Experience Level**: Comfortable with Discord bot management, but limited understanding of how bots interact with XRPL and NFTs.
- **Pain Points**:
  - Wants to build a game to engage community members using their NFTs but doesn’t understand how to link NFTs to users’ Discord profiles.
  - Prefers bots with web-based admin dashboards but isn’t sure how to manage NFT utility or user interaction via Discord.
  - Limited technical knowledge of how wallet connections and NFT associations work in a gaming context.
- **Goals**:
  - Wants to integrate a game that uses NFTs from the XRPL, where users can connect their wallets and play based on their NFT holdings.
  - Needs a web-based admin dashboard for easy management and tracking of game analytics and user engagement.
  - Aims to provide a smooth and exciting experience for his community, while minimizing technical complexity for himself.

### User Story: Chris

As **Chris**, a Discord admin for an XRPL NFT community, I want to **create a game that gives utility to my community members’ NFTs** so that I can keep users engaged and excited about holding their tokens. I’ve used Discord bots in the past that allow me to connect my XRPL wallet to my Discord profile, but I don’t really understand how they work or how I could **associate users’ NFTs with their Discord profiles** for the purpose of playing a game.

My biggest challenge is figuring out how to **build a system that lets users link their XRPL wallets to their Discord accounts** and automatically **recognize which NFTs they own**. I’ve seen bots that handle wallet connections, but I have no idea how they track ownership of specific NFTs or allow that data to influence gameplay. On top of that, I don’t have the technical background to build the game from scratch or manage complicated interactions between Discord, the XRPL, and the game logic.

What I really need is a **pre-built solution or toolset** that simplifies the process. Ideally, it would include a **web-based admin dashboard** where I can manage the game’s settings, user permissions, and **view real-time analytics** on user participation and engagement. If I could **easily set up wallet connections** and define which NFTs can be used in the game without needing to code, that would be perfect.

Overall, I want to offer my community something fun and interactive, where their NFTs can be used in a meaningful way, without spending hours figuring out the technical backend. A **no-code or low-code solution** with support for wallet integration and NFT tracking is what I need to bring this vision to life.

### User Persona: Tanya

- **Name**: Tanya
- **Occupation**: Host of interviews and discussions with XRPL developers and project founders.
- **Experience Level**: Highly social and engaged with the XRPL community, familiar with Twitter Spaces and Discord Voice Chats, but not very tech-focused.
- **Pain Points**:
  - Struggles to keep track of all the events happening in the XRPL community throughout the week.
  - Finds it difficult to notify her followers of her own upcoming events and to discover other events.
  - Wishes there was a shared, centralized place to manage and find all XRPL-related events.
- **Goals**:
  - Wants to easily inform her followers about her interviews and discussions across multiple platforms.
  - Hopes to find and participate in more XRPL events hosted by others without constantly checking different platforms.
  - Desires a shared community calendar where XRPL events can be added and easily tracked by everyone.

### User Story: Tanya

As **Tanya**, a social and enthusiastic member of the XRPL community, I want to **inform my followers about my upcoming events and easily find other XRPL events** so that I can spend more time engaging with the community and less time hunting down event details. I host interviews and discussions with developers and project founders on platforms like Twitter Spaces and Discord Voice Chats, and I’ve noticed that there are so many amazing people in the XRPL space, but it’s becoming overwhelming to keep track of all the events happening throughout the week.

My biggest frustration is that I don’t have a **centralized place to post and discover XRPL events**. Right now, I have to manually notify my followers across different platforms, and sometimes I miss out on events hosted by others because I didn’t see their announcement in time. I wish there was a **shared calendar** that the whole XRPL community could contribute to, where people like me could add our events, and followers could **subscribe** to get notified of what’s happening in real-time.

What would really help me is a **user-friendly tool or app** that connects with popular platforms like Twitter and Discord, where I could quickly post details about my upcoming events and browse the schedule of other events across the XRPL ecosystem. It would save me time and make sure I don’t miss out on exciting discussions. **Automated reminders** for upcoming events would also help me keep my community informed without needing to manually send notifications every time.

My goal is to spend more time **engaging with the amazing people in the XRPL space** and less time juggling different tools just to stay in the loop. If there were a **shared XRPL event calendar** that I could access and contribute to, it would help not only me but the entire community stay connected and grow together.

## Bryan (Animator)
### User Persona: Bryan

- **Name**: Bryan
- **Occupation**: Animator
- **Experience Level**: Familiar with generative art tools like Hashlips but lacks coding experience beyond that.
- **Pain Points**:
  - Wants to create a generative NFT collection with **animated** assets but Hashlips only supports static images.
  - Needs an easy way to generate animated NFT media files and thumbnails without managing complex code or technical workflows.
  - Doesn’t want to worry about metadata creation or hosting.
- **Goals**:
  - Wants to upload his animated layers and have the platform generate the NFTs automatically, including media files and thumbnails.
  - Desires the ability to set generation rules and regenerate specific NFTs if they don’t meet his standards.
  - Seeks an easy way to launch his collection without having to deal with the technical aspects like metadata or file hosting.

---

### User Story: Bryan

As **Bryan**, an animator interested in creating a **generative NFT collection** with my animated layers, I want to **upload my animated assets to a platform that will handle everything from generation to launch** so that I can focus on the creative side and not worry about technical details like metadata or hosting. I’ve used Hashlips to generate static image collections before, but **it doesn’t support animated files**, which is frustrating because my work is all about motion and dynamic visuals.

Right now, I need a platform where I can simply **upload my animated layers** (such as .gif or .mp4 files), and it will automatically generate the final NFT media files for me, as well as **create thumbnails** for each one. It’s important to me that I can set **generation rules** (e.g., which layers can’t overlap) and have the ability to **regenerate specific NFTs** if I’m not happy with the results, without needing to redo the whole collection.

I’m also worried about **managing metadata** and where the files will be hosted. I don’t want to deal with figuring out decentralized storage or CDNs—**I just want the platform to handle it for me** so I can focus on getting the artwork right. Ideally, once the collection is generated, the platform should also help me **launch the NFTs**, making the process smooth from start to finish.

My goal is to make a **generative collection that showcases my animated artwork** in a way that’s technically sound but doesn’t require me to be a developer. I want to ensure everything is handled properly on the backend, from metadata to hosting, without needing to understand the details myself. With a **simple, intuitive tool** that lets me control the generation process while automating the rest, I could confidently release my animated NFT collection.

## Eileen (Memecoiner)

- **Name**: Eileen
- **Occupation**: Crypto enthusiast, loves memecoins.
- **Experience Level**: Enthusiastic about memecoins but limited knowledge of the technical side of creating them.
- **Pain Points**:
  - Wants to create her own memecoin but doesn’t know how to handle **token creation** or manage important token settings like **Burnable**, **Freezing**, or **restricting who can hold the token**.
  - Struggles with setting up an airdrop and ensuring bots don’t participate.
  - Needs an easy-to-use interface that integrates with Twitter for community engagement and makes it easy to distribute tokens.
- **Goals**:
  - Wants to create her memecoin and set up an **airdrop** that filters out bots.
  - Desires the ability to **manage token flags** such as Burnable, Freezing, or approving who can hold the token.
  - Seeks a landing page that integrates the airdrop, AMM pool, and DEX access, with a simple way to direct people to it via her own domain (DNS).
  - Desires a streamlined experience that lets her focus on the fun and community aspects of memecoins.
### User Story: Eileen

As **Eileen**, a memecoin enthusiast, I want to **create my own memecoin** and run an **airdrop** that filters out bots so that I can engage with the community in a fun and meaningful way. I think memecoins are awesome, but I have no idea how to handle **token creation** or **manage important token settings** like making the token **burnable**, **freezing certain accounts**, or **restricting who can hold the token**. I’ve heard that these settings are important for controlling the supply and keeping my token secure, but I don’t know how to implement them myself.

Ideally, I need a **simple interface** where I can easily create my memecoin and choose the right settings for it. I want the ability to set **flags like Burnable**, so that tokens can be destroyed if needed, or **Freezing** to block problematic accounts. I also want to be able to **approve who can hold the token** if I decide to create a more exclusive community. 

In addition, I need a way to **set up an airdrop** and define **rules to weed out bots**, perhaps by linking to Twitter accounts or verifying that users have engaged with my posts. This would help ensure that only real, active community members can participate in the airdrop. 

Once my token is created, I want to set up an **AMM pool** for liquidity and make the token available on a **decentralized exchange (DEX)**, but that part feels complicated. I’m looking for a platform that can handle these steps for me, while I focus on promoting the memecoin and engaging with my community.

A **landing page** that integrates the airdrop, token trading, and AMM pool in one place would be perfect. If I could **link my DNS to this landing page**, it would make it easy for people to join the airdrop, trade the token, and participate in the community. It would be even better if this platform also **connected with Twitter** since that’s where I engage with most of my followers, allowing for more interactive and fun airdrop participation.

In the end, I want to focus on building a **fun and engaged community** around my memecoin, without worrying about technical details like **tokenomics, flags, AMM pools**, or **DEXs**. A **user-friendly platform** that walks me through **token creation**, **flag management**, **airdrop setup**, and **liquidity options** all at once would make my memecoin journey much more manageable.

## Alex (Musician)
### User Persona: Alex

- **Name**: Alex
- **Occupation**: Musician
- **Experience Level**: Comfortable hosting his own website, but has limited technical knowledge of blockchain and NFTs beyond basic minting concepts.
- **Pain Points**:
  - Wants to release his music as NFTs through **Open Edition Mints**, but doesn’t know how to create the minting page with a timer.
  - Needs a way for users to mint his songs during a limited time window without worrying about complex coding or smart contracts.
- **Goals**:
  - Wants a **simple tool** to create a **minting page** for his latest song that includes a **timer** allowing users to mint only until the time expires.
  - Hopes to integrate the minting functionality seamlessly into his existing website.
  - Desires an easy process for setting up and managing Open Edition Mints to release new music as NFTs.

---

### User Story: Alex

As **Alex**, a musician looking to release my songs as NFTs, I want to **create an Open Edition Minting page with a timer** so that my fans can mint my latest song as an NFT for a limited time. I’m comfortable hosting my own website, but I don’t have the technical expertise to figure out how to **add a minting page with a countdown timer** that stops the minting process when the time runs out.

What I need is a **simple platform** that allows me to **set up a minting page** where I can upload my song and define a **time limit** for the mint. Once the timer expires, minting should automatically stop. It would be ideal if this platform could **integrate directly into my website**, so fans could visit the site, see the current song available for minting, and interact with the page without needing to be redirected elsewhere.

I would also like the ability to **track how many NFTs have been minted** in real time and ensure that my songs are only available during the specified period. Having a platform that can handle the technical aspects of **creating and managing NFTs**—like metadata, minting logic, and smart contracts—would let me focus on **creating and promoting my music** instead of worrying about how the blockchain works.

Ultimately, I want a **seamless minting experience** that gives my fans access to exclusive, time-limited NFT releases, while allowing me to maintain control over my website and the way my music is presented. If the process is streamlined, I could use this method to regularly release new tracks as NFTs through Open Edition Mints.
